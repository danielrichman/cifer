Hill Cipher Matrix post:
http://ardsrk.blogspot.com/2006/04/hill-cipher-deciphered.html

Ciphers we need to crack (cross them off):
[X] Caesar                   0.01
[X] Vigenere                 Milliseconds
[X] Affine                   Creamed
[X] Affine - bruteforce      Bewm, headshot!
[X] Multiplicative           (Just use --affine)
[X] Keyword                  OWNED
[X] Bacon                    Smushed.
[X] Polybius Square          Taken to pieces.
[X] Columnar Transposition   Speedy (!) - see below
[X] Rail Fence               (DRebellion shotgun Sun, 28 Sep 2008 :P)
[ ] Morse Code
[ ] Playfair
[ ] Double Playfair
[ ] Autokey                  (Daniel Richman wants this one :D )
[ ] Alberti
[ ] ADFGVX
[ ] Solitaire
[ ] Hill
[ ] Book
[ ] Enigma
[ ] Fialka                   (Is this really needed?)

Features that are needed
[X] Reimplement fast dictionary searching (Assigned to DR): _pro
[ ] Columnar Transposition: perhaps some intelligent guessing or 
    gen alg for faster winnness? Scanning for anagrams? Looking for
    digits/numbers that are most likely togheter in the ptext? 
    Easiest anagram perhaps THE searching.
[X] Bigrams and Trigrams frequency data
[ ] Detection and guessing of cipher, eg- Delta IC tells us that the letters are
    not totally malformed and just need a caesar/vigenere crack? etc.
    "The AutoPWN mode"
[X] Printing of the process used to arrive at the cipher, eg. Cipher methods 
    used, keywords, the lot.
[X] Implement proper command line parsing using flags (-*) so we can tell the
    program exactly what we need to do.
[X] Arg.c and Action.c are a mess, need to be more... dynamic
[X] Better handling of input and output, perhaps a function defines what types
    of chars it takes and input will preprocess them ready
[X] Dictionary _fast and _pro need to take non-alpha chars and discard them;
    perhaps some sort of system for specifing if the input will have such
    dirties
    in it and then enabling the slightly-insignificantly slower bits? Mebe? no.
[X] Support for numbers etc. in all functions. Transposition functions are 
    already there and _pro and _fast (dictioary) should support them. 
    However, count_(trigrams|digrams|freq) need support for non-alpha chars 
    aswell as delta_ic
[ ] Support for alphabet deformation, different alphabets and also vowel 
    destruction; see ncc 08-3b
