Hill Cipher Matrix post:
http://ardsrk.blogspot.com/2006/04/hill-cipher-deciphered.html

Ciphers we need to crack (cross them off):
[X] Caesar                   0.01
[X] Vigenere                 Milliseconds
[X] Affine                   Creamed
[X] Multiplicative           (Just use --affine)
[X] Keyword                  OWNED
[X] Bacon                    Smushed.
[X] Polybius Square          Taken to pieces.
[X] Columnar Transposition   Speedy
[ ] Rail Fence               (DRebellion shotgun Sun, 28 Sep 2008 :P)
[ ] Playfair
[ ] Double Playfair
[ ] Autokey                  (Daniel Richman wants this one :D )
[ ] Alberti
[ ] ADFGVX
[ ] Solitaire
[ ] Hill
[ ] Book
[ ] Enigma
[ ] Fialka                   (Is this really needed?)

Features that are needed
[X] Reimplement fast dictionary searching (Assigned to DR)
[X] Bigrams and Trigrams frequency data
[ ] Detection and guessing of cipher, eg- Delta IC tells us that the letters are
    not totally malformed and just need a caesar/vigenere crack? etc.
    "The AutoPWN mode"
[ ] Epic win phrases when it cracks a cipher, eg. "Yum yum, that was an epic 
    fail of a cipher" or "Totally freaking owned"
[X] Printing of the process used to arrive at the cipher, eg. Cipher methods 
    used, keywords, the lot.
[X] Implement proper command line parsing using flags (-*) so we can tell the
    program exactly what we need to do.
