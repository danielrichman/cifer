  INFO
===============================================================================

Cifer provides many functions designed to aid in cracking classical
ciphers; a group of ciphers used historically, but which have now
fallen into disuse because of their suceptability to ciphertext-only
attacks. In general, they were designed and implemented by hand, and
operate on an alphabet of letters (such as [A-Z]).

It operates using text files as input and output, and can perform both brute
force and other, more sophisticated, attacks against many classic encryption
schemes. In addition, it provides many utilities such as frequency analysis
and automated encryption/decryption of texts.

For more information, view the manpages:

$ man manpages/cifer.1
$ man manpages/cifer-dict.1
