to general soult from the hand of general latour maubourg

a report on the action on the plains of estremadura.
our armies gathered on the plains of estremadura preparing an attack on the british forces
concentrated there under the command of marshal beresford. his troops were invested in badajoz,
presumably in preparation for an assault on almeida, and it was clear that his lines of supply were
extended.
the newly ennobled wellesley, now viscount wellington, sent two divisions and some small suite of
staff officers to reinforce beresfords group, but your own heavy attack wrought serious damage on
them, and, while it was repulsed, it is reported that around four in ten of his redcoats were killed or
wounded. one notable victory - an entire infantry brigade allowed themselves to be flanked by our
cavalry and of their fifteen hundred soldiers, over twelve hundred were killed, wounded or
captured by our brave men and horses.
beresford himself was engaged by a polish lancer and ordered a general retreat, perhaps
demonstrating the lack of resolve of certain of the english officers. regrettably, a brigade of
fusiliers galloped forward from their reserve and our own lines faltered in the attack. some credit
the english officer hardinge with this reversal in our fortunes, but there are lessons to be learned
from the encounter, not least that we must stiffen our own resolve to press the advantage when it
presents itself.
vive la france
